This is a constantly updated pack of my scripts. 

Features (as of yet):
- simple ESP with admin recognition
	-additional costumizable Printer/Entitiy finder
-Chat- and Console Commandspammer
- bunnyhop script
- flashlight spammer
- DarkRP Namechanger

How to run the script?
Type "lua_openscript_cl autorun/client/lennys.lua" in the console to run the scripts. 
To open the configuration menu run the command "lenny_menu". 

Note:
If the Menu doesn't open up, try running the command "lenny_reload" a few times. It's helpfull to fix a lot of bugs. So everytime something doesn't do what it's supposed to, spam the console with it.

To change your name quickly in DarkRP type "lenny_namechange". (Binding this to a key is a good idea)

Available commands:
lenny_menu --opens the configuration menu
lenny_reload --reloads the script (usefull to fix errors, bugs, etc...)
lenny_namechange --runs the chatcommand "/rpname" in DarkRP and changes it to a random one. (Lookup the sourecode to modify them.)

Available cvars:
lenny_esp -- enables/disables the ESP
lenny_esp_entities -- enables/disables the Entity ESP
lenny_bunnyhop -- enables/disables the bunnyshop script
lenny_flashlight -- enables/disables the flashlight spammer
lenny_chatspam -- enables/disables the chat/command spam
lenny_spamchatorcommand -- 1 = Spam a chatmessage, 0 = spam a console command
